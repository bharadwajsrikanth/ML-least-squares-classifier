# ML-least-squares-classifier
Implementation of a multi-class least squares classifier

A homegrown multi class least squares classifier on the Iris dataset after separating it to training and testing set.
Mis-classification error for each class and overall error is documented by analysis of the confusion matrix.
The ratios attempted for training and testing are 12% training/88% testing, 30% train- ing/70% testing and 50% training/50% testing (and these percentages are class specific).
